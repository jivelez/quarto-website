I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of [Industrial Engineering](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/ingenieria-industrial), [Universidad del Norte](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/), [Barranquilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barranquilla), [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia). My research interests span applied analytics, bioinformatics, population genetics and Machine Learning. <!--, genetic epidemiology, predictive genomics, applied data analytics and Machine Learning. <!-- applied to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Breast and Prostate Cancer, Autoimmune Diseases (AID) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). -->

I earned a PhD degree in Medical Sciences with emphasis in Genomics and Precision Medicine from the  [John Curtin School of Medical Research](https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/) at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Mauricio Arcos-Burgos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MZlwFqgAAAAJ&hl=es&authuser=1). Before moving to Australia, I conducted research on statistical genetics and bioinformatics at the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) in Bethesda, MD, USA under the supervision of [Max Muenke](https://www.genome.gov/player/wyo8AF_3nz8/PL1ay9ko4A8sk0o9O-YhseFHzbU2I2HQQp) and Mauricio Arcos-Burgos, within the [Medical Genetics Branch](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Division-of-Intramural-Research/Medical-Genetics-Branch).

<!--the [Medical Genetics Branch](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Division-of-Intramural-Research/Medical-Genetics-Branch), National Human Genome Research Institute ([NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/)), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, under the supervision of [Max Muenke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-max-muenke-138932198) and Mauricio Arcos-Burgos. -->

<!-- earned a BSc in Industrial Engineering and a MSc in Statistics from the [National University of Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/en.html), [Medellin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn). I also conducted research on statistical genetics and bioinformatics at the [Medical Genetics Branch](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Division-of-Intramural-Research/Medical-Genetics-Branch), National Human Genome Research Institute ([NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/)), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, under the supervision of [Max Muenke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-max-muenke-138932198) and Mauricio Arcos-Burgos. -->

<!-- I have 18 years of experience in the development and/or application of statistical methods to analyse and represent data.  <!-- genetic, demographic, industrial and financial data. <!-- , I also have strong foundations and knowledge in engineering, genetics (i.e., statistical, population and quantitative genetics, and genetic epidemiology) and statistical computing. as well as an in-deep understanding of the computational, mathematical, and statistical theories and methodologies involved. -->

<!-- in  engineering, statistical computing and genetics (i.e., statistical, population and quantitative genetics, genetic epidemiology and genomics), -->

<!-- Thanks to my background and expertise,  I have been a key member of multidisciplinary groups in academia, including teaching and research, in Colombia, USA and Australia. 

<!-- Since 2020, I have been working on the identification of common functional genetic variants that modify the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with sporadic AD, as well as variants that confer susceptibility to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Autoimmune diseases, and Huntington's disease in individuals from the Colombian Caribbean region. -->
```

Since October 2022, I lead the [Alzheimer's disease (AD) SGR study](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/hospital/proyecto-de-investigacion-en-alzheimer).  This initiative is dedicated to unraveling the genetic landscape associated to AD susceptibility, age of onset, and disease progression in individuals from the [Atlántico Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl%C3%A1ntico_Department).
