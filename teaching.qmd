Over the years, I have had the privilege of teaching a diverse range of courses that reflect my expertise in applied analytics, bioinformatics, population genetics, and Machine Learning. 

As an Assistant Professor at the Department of Industrial Engineering, I have been in charge of the following courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels:

**Undergraduate courses**

* Data Analysis in Engineering II
* Applied Data Analytics

**Graduate courses**

* Design of Experiments
* Computational Analytics

In addition, I have had the opportunity of teaching at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Department of Medicine.  In those departments, I have offered the following graduate courses:

* Bioinformatics
* Population Genetics
* Advanced Statistics IV

My teaching philosophy centers on fostering analytical thinking, practical problem-solving, and interdisciplinary collaboration. 

My courses are designed to equip students with both the theoretical foundations and hands-on skills necessary to address real-world challenges in engineering, data science, and biomedical research. Through a combination of lectures, case studies, and project-based learning, I strive to create an engaging and supportive environment where students can develop the competencies needed to excel in academia, industry, and research.
